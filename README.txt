1. Project Full Name

Virtual Market of Energy (VME). The project "Unix Name" is "vmenergy".

2. Project Purpose And Summarization

VME is an IoT-based automation platform for demand-response (DR) and electricity flexibility management and trading. 
VME is suitable for different DR applications and can scale up to millions of distributed electricity Prosumers (consumers 
and/or producers), Aggregators, and Market actors. VME is a hierarchical system-of-systems, which interconnects a large 
number of Prosumers, Aggregators, and Market nodes using the two-way XMPP communication. In VME, flexibility of different 
Prosumer loads is generalized, modeled, and explicitly represented as so-called Flex-Offers. Flex-Offers from thousands 
of Prosumers are collected by an Aggregator. Aggregator combines (aggregates) thousands of Prosumer Flex-Offers into fewer 
aggregated Flex-Offers. Aggregated Flex-Offers capture much larger energy amounts and flexibility and thus are more valuable 
(e.g., on the market). Aggregated Flex-Offers are used by Aggregators to generate aggregated execution schedules, which are 
then disaggregated and distributed back to the Prosumers. Prosumers rewards are calculated based on how well the schedules 
are executed and on the time and energy amount flexibilities offered through Flex-Offers. VME is an open source project, 
uses the Arrowhead Framework, and was developed in the Danish TotalFlex project (http://www.totalflex.dk/) and the European's 
largest automation Arrowhead project (http://www.arrowhead.eu).

3. Project Public Description

VME is an IoT-based automation platform for demand-response (DR) and electricity flexibility management and trading. VME is 
suitable for different DR applications and can scale up to millions of distributed electricity Prosumers (consumers and/or 
producers), Aggregators, and Market actors. The central concept in VME is a so-called FlexOffer, which generalizes and allows 
modelling and explicitly capturing flexibility in electricity consumption and/or production both at the prosumer, aggregator, 
and maket levels. VME natively supports Flex-Offers and integrates Flex-Offer aggregation/disaggregation techniques, as well 
as analytics. VME is an open source project, uses the Arrowhead Framework, and was developed in the Danish TotalFlex project 
(http://www.totalflex.dk/) and the European's largest automation Arrowhead project (http://www.arrowhead.eu).
